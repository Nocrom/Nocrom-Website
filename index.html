        <p><br>Awhile ago (October 27th, 2019), I started my YouTube Channel and I named it "Nocrom."</p>
        <p>It was growing very slowly, until I posted my 10th video called "Peppa Pig Sings the Box</p>
        <p>When I posted this, I was rapidly growing until September 2020, when the most unexpected thing happened.</p>
        <p>My channel had been terminated for "Underage Streaming." I was only 12 at the time, so I put my age as older than my real age.</p>
        <p>I made a new channel (still with the name Nocrom), and I've been on it ever since my old channel was terminated.</p>
